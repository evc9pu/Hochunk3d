1)  move
NO = CSPOT = YES if spots on star, NO if not
45. = SPOTLAT = latitude of spot (degrees)
1 = NSPOT = number of spots (1 or 2)

to
'**** Disk accretion properties ****'

2) change above to
'**** Disk/star accretion properties ****'

3)  change
ALPHA to ALPHA/MDOT

4)  delete 
FSPOT  line

5)  add
NO = CTEMP = YES to read spot temperature, NO to read Fractional spot size (computes one from the other)
0.01 = TSPOT/FSPOT = Temperature of spot (CTEMP=YES) or Fractional area of hot spot (CTEMP=NO)

after 
1 = NSPOT line

6) set IMCUBE = NO

7)  run code for a few seconds as a check
